This examples shows how to run Rietveld - the code review tool available
at http://codereview.appspot.com/.

Before you are able to run this example you need to obtain a recent version
of Rietveld. There are two ways to do this. Either set it up manually or
use the Makefile in this directory.

Upgrading Rietveld on Django
============================

To upgrade your Rietveld on Django installation just do the following:

 * Have a look at the current Makefile. Remember the Rietveld revision
   (at the top of the Makefile) you're currently running.
 * Update the gae2django sources from the Subversion repository (svn
   up).
 * Have a look at examples/rietveld/UPDATES if you need to do manual
   database changes. You only have to do manual database changes if
   there are entries in that file for Rietveld revisions greater than
   the one you've remembered in the first step.


Manual Setup
============

For the start you need to install django = 1.2.7

    pip install django==1.2.7

Checkout the code from github

    git clone https://github.com/zhaoxuan/rietveld.git

Finally run

    ./manage.py syncdb

to initialize the example database.

    ./manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

will run Rietveld in development mode.


Production Deployment
=====================

The preferred method to deploy Django applications is to use WSGI supporting
web server. You may copy codereview.wsgi.example and edit it to change
/var/rietveld path to point to your installation.

There is one important thing to remember. Django serves media (static) files
only in development mode. For running Rietveld in a production environment,
you need to setup your web-server to serve the /static/ alias directly.

http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/howto/deployment/modpython/#serving-media-files

There is the example configuration for running Rietveld with Apache2+mod_wsgi
Feel free to copy it from apache.conf.example. You may need to change
'codereview' user name in WSGI directives and adjust paths to match your
installation.

When running in a production environment, keep in Django's CSRF
protection is disabled in this example!


Adding Users
============

Go to /admin URL and login as a super user. Users may change password by
going to /admin/password_change URL.
